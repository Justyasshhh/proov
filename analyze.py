# Make KM-Waechter smarter. The 80% rule only warns you once a car is nearly worn. Here you find
# which cars are most likely to break down SOON, from their history, and rank them by risk, so the
# fleet team fixes the risky ones first.
#
# fleet_history.csv has one row per car (120 of them) and a "broke_down" column (1 = it later
# broke down).
#
# TODO(you), with IBM Bob and pandas:
#   1. Load fleet_history.csv.
#   2. Find which columns actually separate the cars that broke down from those that did not.
#      Do not assume. Compare the two groups column by column and let the numbers answer.
#      (Total mileage and age look like the obvious answers. Check whether they really are.)
#   3. Build a simple risk score from 0 to 100 for each car, from the columns that DO separate.
#      No heavy machine learning needed.
#   4. Print the cars ranked by risk, highest first.
#   5. Write a two-line summary at the top of this file: which factors matter most, and why.
